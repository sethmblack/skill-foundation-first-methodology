# Foundation-First Methodology

Establish foundational principles before building details, ensuring structure supports elaboration - following Bach's thoroughbass approach where the bass line determines everything above it.

---

## When to Use

- Lost in details without clear priorities
- Starting a complex project without knowing where to begin
- Proposed solution feels elaborate but shaky
- Decorating without structure
- User asks "What's the foundation?" or "I'm lost in details"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The complex situation or project |
| current_state | No | What's been built or proposed so far |
| confusion | No | Where you feel lost or overwhelmed |

## The Figured Bass Principle

In Baroque music, the figured bass (thoroughbass) is a bass line with numbers indicating the harmonies above. The bass moves; the upper voices follow. Get the bass line wrong, and no amount of beautiful melody will save the piece.

### Why Foundation First

**1. Bass determines harmony**
In Bach's method, you don't start with melodies and try to harmonize them. You start with the bass - the foundation - and let the upper voices emerge naturally from it. Similarly, surface solutions built on weak foundations collapse.

**2. Elaboration amplifies foundation**
If your foundation is strong, ornamentation makes it more beautiful. If your foundation is weak, ornamentation makes the weakness more obvious. Decoration on a flawed structure just highlights the flaw.

**3. Foundations clarify decisions**
When the bass line is set, most decisions about upper voices become obvious. When foundations are unclear, every detail requires agonizing debate.

**4. Foundations compress complexity**
A four-note bass pattern can generate an entire passacaglia. Foundational principles, properly chosen, simplify everything built on them.

### Bach's Definition
"The harmony of a triad is the result of a contrapuntal structure."

Harmony emerges from voice-leading, not the reverse. Structure first, decoration second.

## The Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Bass Line
What is the fundamental purpose, principle, or function?
- Strip away features, details, nice-to-haves
- What remains if you remove everything removable?
- What single sentence captures the foundation?

### Step 2: Test the Foundation
Is this bass line solid enough to build on?
- Does it support the weight of what's above it?
- Is it simple enough to remember under pressure?
- Does it clarify rather than complicate decisions?

### Step 3: Establish the Harmonic Framework
What are the primary chord changes?
- What are the 3-5 key principles that flow from the foundation?
- How does the bass line move through its main stations?
- What is the harmonic rhythm (pace of fundamental change)?

### Step 4: Add Upper Voices in Order
What comes next, and next, and next?
- Don't jump to melody before harmony is set
- Each layer should be determined by what's below
- Resist decorating before structure is complete

### Step 5: Now Ornament
Only when the structure is solid, add the finishing touches
- Ornamentation serves structure, not the reverse
- Beauty emerges from strong foundation, not hiding weakness

```markdown
## Foundation-First Analysis

### The Bass Line (Fundamental Purpose)
[One sentence capturing the foundation]

### Foundation Test
- [ ] Supports the weight of everything above
- [ ] Simple enough to remember under pressure
- [ ] Clarifies decisions when referenced

### The Harmonic Framework (Key Principles)
1. [First chord - primary principle flowing from bass]
2. [Second chord - secondary principle]
3. [Third chord - tertiary principle]
[Continue as needed]

### The Hierarchy
| Level | Element | Determined By |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Foundation | [Bass line] | Core purpose |
| Structure | [First layer] | Foundation |
| Support | [Second layer] | Structure |
| Surface | [Details/decoration] | All above |

### Building Order
1. Establish: [Foundation element]
2. Then: [Structural element]
3. Then: [Support element]
4. Finally: [Decoration/detail]

### What Can Now Be Cut
[Elements that seemed important but don't connect to foundation]

### The Foundation Principle
[One sentence capturing what this foundation-first analysis reveals]

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient input data | Request specific additional information needed for analysis |
| Ambiguous requirements | Ask clarifying questions before proceeding |
| Conflicting constraints | Highlight the conflicts and ask for prioritization |
| Out of scope request | Explain the skill's boundaries and suggest alternatives |
| Incomplete analysis | Acknowledge limitations and indicate what additional inputs would help |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I'm trying to plan a new product launch but I'm drowning in details - marketing channels, features, pricing tiers, partnerships. I don't know where to start."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Foundation-First Analysis

### The Bass Line (Fundamental Purpose)
**This product exists to [solve specific problem] for [specific customer] so that [specific outcome].**

Before choosing marketing channels, you must be able to complete this sentence in a way that a sixth-grader would understand. Everything else is ornamentation.

Let's say, after clarification, your bass line is:
*"This product exists to help busy parents track their children's homework assignments so that evening chaos becomes calm."*

### Foundation Test
- [x] Supports weight: Every feature, channel, and pricing decision can be tested against "does this help busy parents reduce evening chaos?"
- [x] Simple: 15 words. Memorable under pressure.
- [x] Clarifies decisions: "Should we add a feature for teachers?" - Does it reduce evening chaos for parents? No? Then not yet.

### The Harmonic Framework (Key Principles)
1. **Busy parents** - They have no time. Everything must be fast and obvious.
2. **Track homework** - The core function. Must work flawlessly before anything else.
3. **Evening chaos to calm** - The emotional transformation. This is what we're selling.

These three chords determine everything:
- Marketing speaks to busy parents, in places busy parents are
- Product prioritizes speed and simplicity over feature richness
- Success is measured in stress reduction, not feature usage

### The Hierarchy
| Level | Element | Determined By |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Foundation | Solve evening homework chaos for busy parents | Core purpose |
| Structure | Simple tracking that works instantly | Foundation |
| Support | Integrations with school systems | Structure |
| Surface | Premium themes, social features | All above |

### Building Order
1. **Establish:** One-screen homework tracking that works in 10 seconds
2. **Then:** Notification system so parents never miss an assignment
3. **Then:** School system integration so data appears automatically
4. **Finally:** Premium features, referral programs, tier pricing

You cannot effectively choose marketing channels until step 1 is solid. You cannot price tiers until you know what the tiers are. You cannot evaluate partnerships until you know what partners would add.

### What Can Now Be Cut
- "Social features for kids" - Not connected to parental chaos reduction
- "Gamification for homework completion" - Nice, but structure before surface
- "Teacher communication tools" - Different product, different bass line
- "Twelve marketing channels" - Pick two that reach busy parents; master them

### The Foundation Principle
When you're drowning in details, you've started decorating before building. Return to the bass line: who, what, why. Let every detail prove its connection to that foundation. What can't prove connection gets cut.

## The Bach Approach

Bach's students didn't start with fugues. They started with figured bass - learning how the foundation determines everything above it. Only after mastering the bass did they add voices.

Your product launch is the same. Don't start with channels and features. Start with the bass: who you serve, what problem you solve, what transformation you provide. Master that, and the upper voices will find their natural paths.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Johann Sebastian Bach** expert persona. Use it when you're lost in details and need to return to first principles, or when a proposed solution feels elaborate but unstable.
